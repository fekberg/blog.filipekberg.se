For those that don't want to install the Windows 8 Developer Preview on their workstation just to try out and develop applications in Visual Studio 11, I can happily say that Visual Studio 11 runs perfectly fine side by side Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7!<!--excerpt-->

You can download the Visual Studio 11 Developer Preview on MSDN by <a href="http://t.co/0djD8PIh">clicking here</a>!
