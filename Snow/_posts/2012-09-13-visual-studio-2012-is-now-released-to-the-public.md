On September 12, 2012, Visual Studio 2012 was released to the public and Microsoft of course had a very nice <a href="http://www.visualstudiolaunch.com/">release event</a>. As I couldn't attend in person (it's a 14 hour flight from where I live to Seattle) I as many others watched the live-stream from <a href="http://www.visualstudiolaunch.com/">VisualStudioLaunch.com</a>.<!--excerpt-->

During the last 6 months I've had the pleasure to work with what is today known as Visual Studio 2012. This is (all colors aside) by far the best IDE that I've ever worked with. I'm of course biased since I've worked with Visual Studio since as far back as I can remember, but it's truly been a great improvement since then.

Microsoft did not only announce all improvements and new features, they also announced that they will release updates to Visual Studio 2012 more often than what we have been used to before. The first update will be released before the end of the year and we will see a CTP version of this before the end of the month.

To get more familiar with all the new features that comes with Visual Studio 2012, .NET 4.5 and so forth, Microsoft has put a lot of effort into creating <a href="http://www.visualstudiolaunch.com/vs2012vle/Modernapps">screencasts </a>on each subject. These screencasts can be found at the <a href="http://www.visualstudiolaunch.com/vs2012vle/Modernapps">Visual Studio 2012 Launch site</a>.

<h3>Visual Studio 2012 Express versions</h3>
If you haven't already downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2012, you should be sure to do so. 

You can find the <strong>free</strong> Express versions here:

Another very nice add-on that Microsoft announced together with Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web is that you can now use F# in your ASP.NET applications. You can get the "F# Tools for Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web" <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=FSharpVWD11">through the web platform installer.</a> Be sure to check out the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fsharpteam/archive/2012/09/12/announcing-the-release-of-f-tools-for-visual-studio-express-2012-for-web.aspx">F# Team Blog</a>'s announcement on this.

Let's build great apps with Visual Studio 2012, happy coding!
