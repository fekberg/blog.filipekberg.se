2012 has been an amazing year, don't worry there's a summary post coming! One of my greatest achievements was finishing and publishing my book C# Smorgasbord. Between all the writing and marketing I've had the pleasure to do screencasts, user group presentations and of course a lot of fun blog posts!

All these contributions has been noticed and 2013 could not have started better, I just received this e-mail from Microsoft:

<blockquote>
Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2013 MicrosoftÂ® MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in Visual C# technical communities during the past year.

It is a great honor and I look forward to all the amazing things we will discover together in 2013!

Thank you all for making this possible!
