For the past 1 year and 8 months I've worked with some of the best people in my career at Readify. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to move to Australia and work with these amazing people!<br/><br/>For the past 10 years I've worked as a consultant in some way or another and it's been a great journey! I'm super excited to step into a product company and face some really exciting challenges.<br/><br/>Working for Readify has given me a lot of confidence and opportunities to work on myself, which I am eternally grateful for. When moving to Australia I had never done any public speaking in English and it's been exciting to get better and better at this over time. Joining Invoice2Go means I will still be living and working in Australia, which is great, the development community here is so friendly and exciting!

I would really like to thank everyone that has attended my sessions, watched my courses, read my book or visited this blog; you are all the reason I love doing what I do. Without your support, I would never have moved to Australia and I would never have had the opportunity to work with these great companies!
