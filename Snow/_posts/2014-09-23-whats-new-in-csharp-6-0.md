I was again invited to write an article for DNC Magazine, this time on the changes that we will see in the upcoming language changes coming in C# 6.0.

> We will not necessarily see new keywords in C# vNext, but we will see semantic differences that will make it easier for developers to avoid boilerplate code. 
> Some of these introduced semantic differences are much awaited and some of them are solving thinner edge cases; they are all very welcomed by the community! As the next version of the compiler is still under development, some of the language features may be taken out, some may be added and some may be delayed to the version after vNext. 
> The evolution of C# is a proof that the language lives, people are using it and it is here to stay.
