I really enjoy sharing my experience and knowledge with others and I've been considering creating more screencasts. But as an alternative to screencasts, I am considering doing online-training with something like <a href="http://www.gotomeeting.com/fec/training/online_training">GoToTraining</a> instead. This will allow higher quality, interactive sessions and much more.<!--excerpt-->

Therefore, I would like to see if there's any interest in something like this. Let us assume any subject around C#/Windows 8/Programming in general.

Looking forward to see what you think! If you want to suggest a topic for training, let me know in the comment field.
