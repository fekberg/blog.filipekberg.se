<img src="http://s.pluralsight.com/author/sm/filip-ekberg-v1.png" style="float: right; padding: 5px;" />It's truly a pleasure to announce that as of Friday last week I am a published <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/filip-ekberg" title="Filip Ekberg - Pluralsight Author" target="_blank">Pluralsight Author</a>! The course that I published is called <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Description/msil-csharp-developer" target="_blank">MSIL for the C# Developer</a>, read more about it at the end of this post. There's been some radio silence on the blog lately, it's mostly due to a lot of effort that has gone into the production of the newly released course and also our move to Australia.<!--excerpt-->

<h3>Win a Pluralsight Annual Plus Subscription</h3>
To celebrate that I just published my course I'm raffling away the following:

<ul>

</ul>

<h4>How do I win?</h4>
It's Simple!

<h3>What's the course about?</h3>
In this course we look at MSIL; the code that is generated when you compile C#. We explore MSIL so that you get a better understanding of how C# works and how it is compiled. Ultimately after completing the course you will feel like a better C# developer as you will know much more about what happens behind the scenes when we compile our C# applications.
