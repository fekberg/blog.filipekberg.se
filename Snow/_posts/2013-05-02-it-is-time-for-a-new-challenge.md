<em>This post is in a more personal manner than what you might be used to from this blog so if you're just interested in lines of code you can stop reading now.</em>

In 2006 I had my eyes on working abroad and thus I figured that in order to do this I needed to at least have a bachelor degree in Software Engineering. Now 7 years later I've had my bachelor degree for a while and I've gathered a lot of experience along  the way; but what I have not done so far is work abroad.<!--excerpt-->

While there are a lot of interesting things happening in my professional life and in my personal life with my lovely fianc√©e Sofie, there's still something that I feel I want to do.

I'm truly honored to do this and I'm really looking forward to getting this out there to all of you.

However, over the years a lot of things have changed. I met my better half and the things that I had previously prioritized changed and the dreams about working abroad were put aside. Now both I and Sofie are in a place in life where we feel that we want to try something completely different. I'm really happy to announce that Sofie and I will share the dream that I once had, which was the fundament of me studying for my bachelor degree; <strong>we're moving to Sydney</strong>.

I was offered a position as a senior developer at <a href="http://readify.net/">Readify </a>in Australia and the company is completely in line with what I value and they work exactly as I want. It's going to be a great experience and I hope that I will meet a lot of new friends and get a lot of new knowledge.

We are both really excited about this opportunity and we are certain this is going to be a blast.
