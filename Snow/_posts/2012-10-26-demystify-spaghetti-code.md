<h3>Welcome to this week's Friday with Filip!</h3>
Two weeks ago we looked at <a href="http://www.filipekberg.se/2012/10/12/friday-with-filip-dealing-with-code-complexity/">Dealing with Code Complexity</a> using NDepend. This was the first episode in the webinar series on Code Quality.<!--excerpt-->

This week I am happy to share that Patrick Smacchia and I have recorded the second episode! This week it's about dependencies, dependency cycles and spaghetti code. I really enjoyed doing these sessions with Patrick and I really hope you will enjoy it just as much. <strong>Let me know what you think of it!</strong>
