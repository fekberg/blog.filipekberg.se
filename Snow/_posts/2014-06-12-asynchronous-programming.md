I was invited again to the Brisbane C# Mobile Developers to celebrate Xamarin's 3rd Birthday by delivering a half an hour talk on asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming is more important than ever and it's extremely important to understand what is going on when we're working with it. We really want to do whatever we can to avoid deadlocks!<!--excerpt-->

Sit back, enjoy, don't forget to pop some popcorn and let me know if you have any questions, concerns or deadlocks!
