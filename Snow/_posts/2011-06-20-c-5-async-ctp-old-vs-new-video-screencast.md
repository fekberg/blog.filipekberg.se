This is my second screencast, talking about the C# 5 async ctp. In this session I show how you can refactor old code that is using the task parallel library or a background worker to run time consuming operations asynchronously.

I also touch the surface on what continuation is and how it has been acheived using TPL and how it makes life easier when using async and await.<!--excerpt-->
