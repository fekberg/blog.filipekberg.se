In this presentation I'm covering features we can expect to see in the next version of C#. We're also looking at some of the features that we may see in the coming language update!<!--excerpt-->

As always, sit back, relax, enjoy some popcorn and enjoy the upcoming features of C# 6.0!

Are you excited about the changes in the next version of C#? I sure am! Altough I'm probably biased as it's obvious I have a strong love for this language.
