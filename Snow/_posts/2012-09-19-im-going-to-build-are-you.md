I'm happy to finally be able to say that I will be going to <strong>BUILD 2012</strong>! Thanks to my employer <a href="http://www.starrepublic.com/">Star Republic</a>, I will be able to attend this amazing event. During the event I will be blogging and <a href="https://twitter.com/fekberg">tweeting</a> as much as possible. Of course, there will be tons for stuff to blog about even after the event, so stay tuned for all these cool new things that will hopefully be announced at BUILD 2012!<!--excerpt-->

<h3>Are you going to BUILD?</h3>
If you're going to BUILD, let me know. I'd be happy to meet up and have a chat. If you've got a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/C-Smorgasbord-Filip-Ekberg/dp/1468152106/">C# Smorgasbord</a> book that you want signed, I'm sure we can work something out.

I'll be in town from October 27 to November 3!
