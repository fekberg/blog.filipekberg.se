I really hope that you take this chance to learn something from the Pluralsight courses and from the book. The course library is truly outstanding and I really recommend you to watch <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/msil-csharp-developer" target="_blank">my course on MSIL</a>!
