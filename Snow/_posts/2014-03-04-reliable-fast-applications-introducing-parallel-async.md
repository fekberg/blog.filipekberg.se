In this breakfast event that I spoke at which my employer Readify organizes, I talked about Parallel and Asynchronous applications. The idea here is to talk about what makes an application fast and reliable. Then we talk about different concepts and how to apply these in small isolated code snippets to make use of some really powerful stuff we have to our disposal.

This talk is aimed towards C# developers, but the parallel and asynchronous information applies to more than just the .NET family.<!--excerpt-->

Sit back, eat some popcorn and enjoy this 90 minute talk on "<strong>Reliable and fast applications by introducing parallel and asynchronous programming</strong>".

I'd love to hear what you think about it and if you found the information useful!
