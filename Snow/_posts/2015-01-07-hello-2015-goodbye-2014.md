It does feel like time goes faster when you're having a lot of fun, and I sure have had in 2014! I'm truly humbled and honored to be awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award for a third year in a row. I'm really proud to be a .NET MVP!<br/><br/>I have every single one of you to thank for it, without you reading this blog, watching my videos, attending my presentations it wouldn't have been possible. It truly re-fuels me standing in front of a crowd sharing my knowledge, writing about new(or old) things that excites me or recording courses that will help you advance in your career. Speaking of career progression, I'm very happy to have been promoted to Senior Consultant at Readify. Not a single day goes by that I don't learn something new and I truly love it!

It makes me so happy to see that a lot of you are still buying, reading my book and recommending my book C# Smorgasbord. Maybe 2015 will be a good year to start work on a second edition? 

I think it is safe to say that 2014 has been an exciting year for all of us, especially if you are working in the .NET space. A few things from the top of my head that I have been more than excited about:

<ul>
	<li>Roslyn Open-Sourced and Microsoft working much more openly with everything</li>
	<li>C# 6.0 got more language features (and a few less)</li>
	<li>ASP.NET vNext is coming along very nicely</li>
	<li>Windows 10 Preview released</li>
	<li>Visual Studio 2015 Preview released</li>
	<li>Free Community Editon of Visual Studio released</li>
</ul>

Of course, there's been a huge bunch of things that has happened the last 12 months, I bet I forgot one or two big announcements! Personally I had a really good year, I was invited to speak at Mobile/Xamarin user groups in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. I was invited to talk about asynchronous programming, C# 6.0, Azure Mobile Services at user groups. Last but but not least I had the opportunity to deliver a presentation at TechEd Australia (Sydney/Melbourne) and two talks at DeveloperDeveloperDeveloper in Brisbane! Australia has such an inviting community that makes easier to start delivering talks and sharing knowledge. I am positively impressed by the engagement of the crowd, everywhere I go there are always lots of questions which as a Swede I'm not use to.

In the end of 2014 I started working on my next Pluralsight course, which will be on Getting Started with Raygun in .NET. I'm really excited about getting this course out there to you, so bare with me while I do the final recording and editing!

Without further ado here are the links to articles I posted in 2014! Enjoy the read and I hope we'll see each other in 2015!
