Almost two months ago I got my first course published on Pluralsight and I've received a lot of great feedback since! I'm happy to share a 10 minute preview from the course with you all, enjoy!<!--excerpt-->

<blockquote>Are you one of those developers who really wants to understand what happens behind the scenes? If not, you really should become one! Understanding what happens when you compile your C# applications doesn't just give you great insight, it also makes you a better developer. In this course excerpt from MSIL For C# Applications, Filip Ekberg demonstrates how you can combine MSIL and C# to take advantage of things that we can explore and create in runtime. In the full course demos several experiments showing what happens we compile our C# applications, so you can get a better understanding of how C# works, and how it's compiled.</blockquote>
