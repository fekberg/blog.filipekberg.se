I've written a lot about Compilation as a Service with Roslyn before on this blog and I just had a presentation about it, again. This time I talked about how to use Roslyn in order to create plugins. Actually how to create two different types of plugins; plugins using Roslyn to analyze code and plugins written for applications created in Visual Studio using Roslyn to compile code. <!--excerpt-->

I've also written about Roslyn in my recently published book (which is currently on a discounted price!), <a href="http://filipekberg.se/2013/02/04/congratulations-to-the-winners-of-a-free-c-smorgasbord-copy/#discount">be sure to check that out</a>. For your information the book is available in Print, Kindle, PDF, ePub and Mobi; the three last ones here are included in a purchase of the printed copy!

Watch the below presentation and let me know what kind of ideas you get based on it and also let me know if you like it or not!

Enjoy these 50 minutes of Compilation as a Service with Roslyn!
