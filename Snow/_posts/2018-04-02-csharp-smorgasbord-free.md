C# Smorgasbord was first published on July 30, 2012 and was the start of something that I certainly could not have anticipated. At the time I had barely started doing any public speaking at all, nor had I been around the world to lots of interesting conferences.

What initially sparked the idea of writing a book, was when I applied for a job at Spotify, which I didn't get. Just like many others I've always had a hard time proving my skills during interviews, especially when having to code in notepad. As I felt sad having lost the opportunity to work for an extremely interesting company, something sparked inside me, I wanted to prove, not to others, but to myself that I was in fact pretty good at what I do.

As I started to look over the material that I had already produced, and thinking about how I could best put this into a better format, the idea of a smorgasbord came into mind. I had a lot of different topics spread across different formats and being a Swede, it felt rather natural collecting lots of different things and serving it to your friends and family.

I reached out to a few publishing companies and pitched my idea, a few of them liked it and wanted to proceed, but I finally decided: I want to do it all on my own. Which is why I decided to self-publish with CreateSpace (Amazon). I didn't really do it on my own though, I really couldn't have. I had so much great support not only from my beloved partner, Sofie, but from friends and family. I had countless of friends helping me with reviewing content and giving me great ideas. I had friends help me with graphics and covers and finally I had something ready to publish!

After the book was published, I certainly felt a lot more confident. Having worked countless of hours, probably more than 1000-1500 hours on the book, I certainly felt like I had to continue spreading my knowledge. Which lead me into a lot more public speaking!

I did mention that the book opened for a lot of opportunities, and it certainly did. Soon after having published the book, I had the pleasure to meet up with Pluralsight, as they coincidentally were in town for a conference. We started to chat about my book, and my goals, and soon thereafter I produced my first course: [MSIL for the C# Developer!]( https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/msil-csharp-developer)

Writing the book, producing courses for Pluralsight, doing a fair bit of public speaking got me the MVP Award, and when attending the first MVP Summit, I met a really nice fellow from a place called Readify in Australia, which lead me to apply for a job on the other side of the world. 

The rest is history.

Being turned down from a job isn't always a bad thing, I certainly got loads of energy from it, after being sad for a while, which changed the course of my career.

It's now almost 6 years since I published the book, and during these 6 years I've travelled the world, lived in a different continent, and I'm now the father of a beautiful daughter; my journey has just begun.

To celebrate all the above, I'd like to give everyone C# Smorgasbord for free, [you can still purchase the paperback copy](https://www.amazon.com/C-Smorgasbord-Filip-Ekberg/dp/1468152106/), or buy me coffee if we're ever in the same city!

Last but not least, thanks for all the support through the years, without friends from all over the world I'd never be where I am today. Thank you!!
