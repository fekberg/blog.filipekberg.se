Cross-platform development and Xamarin is something that everyone is talking about right now and rightfully so! It makes development for iOS, Android and Windows Phone a delight! I was invited to give an Introduction to Xamarin (+ some more bonus content at the end!) at the Xamarin Hack Day in Sydney.

You can read more about upcoming Xamarin Hack Days around the world on <a href="xamarinhackday.com" target="_blank">xamarinhackday.com</a>.<!--excerpt-->

As always, sit back, relax, enjoy some popcorn and learn some Xamarin!

Have you found yourself around more Xamarin related opportunities later?
