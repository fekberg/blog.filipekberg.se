C# is as relevant as always and is definitely something you want to learn! In this talk I did at [ANZ Coders](http://www.anzcoders.com/), I talk about how C# has changed through history, what it potentially could get in the future and why you want to embrace this lovely programming language.

The point is of course not to alienate any other programming languages, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, F# and many others will be as relevant as they are today in the future. If you take one thing away from this session it should be that C# is living, and it is growing fast. Embrace the future!
