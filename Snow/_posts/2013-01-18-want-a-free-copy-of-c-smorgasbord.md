<strong>Who this book is for</strong>
This book is for those developers that find themselves wanting to explore C# but do not know how or where to start looking. Each chapter contains hands on code examples that can be compiled and tested on your machine.

Although each chapter has code samples, you do not need to use a computer to appreciate the content of this book. The code samples are divided into smaller portions of code, so that you can follow each example and the thoughts around it in an easy way.

No matter if you are an experienced .NET developer or a beginner, you will most certainly find a lot of interesting things in this book. The book covers important patterns and technologies that any developer would benefit from mastering.

It is not required that you have worked with C# before but being familiar to the fundamentals in any of the .NET programming languages will help you on the way.

If you are just now starting to learn C#, this can be a great way for you to learn about different techniques, best practices, patterns and how to think in certain scenarios. But if you have worked with C# development for many years, this book can give you a refreshing view on how to always improve and challenge yourself into becoming a better software engineer.
