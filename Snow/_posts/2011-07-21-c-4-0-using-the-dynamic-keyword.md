This is my third screencast, talking about the dynamic keyword in C# 4.0. In this session I talk briefly about the dynamic keyword, where you might have seen it before and give some examples on how you can use it. I won't go in to depth on the DRL, ExpandoObject or when/when not to use the Dynamic Keyword, that's a whole other video.<!--excerpt-->

As I stated in my last post I want to do short 8 - 15 minute videos scratching on the surface and then go in depth on the parts that most of you find interesting!

If you have any requests or questions regarding this or any other of my videos, don't hesitate to leave a comment.
