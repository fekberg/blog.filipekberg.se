Over the past year I've done a few talks on C# 6.0 and the changes that we can expect from the next version of C#. Interestingly enough, each time I've done this talk a bunch of things have changed. Features have been added, features have been put on-hold and most importantly more people have joined the [discussions on Github](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/2136).

I was invited to speak at the Sydney and Canberra .NET User Groups where I talked about how C# is truly a relevant programming language of the future. It's time to embrace it!<!--excerpt-->
