I was invited to the Brisbane C# Mobile Developers by Glenn, a tutor I met during my first Xamarin University course. He's a great tutor and the Xamarin University lectures are of really high quality, if you can I'd really advice you to join the program!

In this talk I go into, in short, what Xamarin is, how to use a REST API from your applications and what kind of code sharing strategies there are. <strong>Sit back, enjoy and don't forget to pop some popcorn!</strong><!--excerpt-->
