I was honored, to be invited to my first Øredev conference, to speak about two topics that I am very much passionate about. If you've never been to this conference, I can highly recommend checking it out next year. Lots of good talks, conversations and the atmosphere was awesome!<!--excerpt--> Below are the two talks I gave at the conference, it probably won't come as a surprise that their about Xamarin and Asynchronous Programming!
