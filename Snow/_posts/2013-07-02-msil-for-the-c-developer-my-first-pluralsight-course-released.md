I'm very happy to tell you all that my first course on Pluralsight <a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/msil-csharp-developer" target="_blank">MSIL for the C# Developer</a> has been out for about 2 weeks and is doing great! I've received great feedback on the content and I'm really looking forward to start working on my next courses.<!--excerpt-->

<strong>MSIL for the C# Developer:</strong> In this course we look at MSIL; the code that is generated when you compile C#. We explore MSIL so that you get a better understanding of how C# works and how it is compiled.

<a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/msil-csharp-developer" target="_blank">Be sure to check it out and tell me what you thought about it!</a>

Here are some highlights of the course:
<ul>
	<li>Understand what happens when we compile C# code</li>
	<li>Utilize MSIL inside your C# applications</li>
	<li>Understand the TypeBuilder, MethodBuilder and how to create things in runtime</li>
	<li>Understand a lot of different OpCodes and why it matters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Announcement</h3>
I'm also happy to announce my upcoming course: <strong>Game programming with Python and PyGame</strong>! If you don't know Python but want to get a crash course into how you can use it and make something fun out if it, this is going to be a perfect course for you. I can't give you a definitive release date yet, so stay tuned.
