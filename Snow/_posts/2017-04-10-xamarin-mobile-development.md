During my visit to NDC London, where I talked about Asynchronous Programming, I also got a chance to record a Play by Play with **[Lars Klint!](https://larsklint.com/)** The course we recorded gives you an introduction to what it's like to build **native** mobile applications in .NET, using Xamarin!<!--excerpt--> 

I've been working with some really interesting projects using Xamarin, the last few years, and this technology is just getting better and better with every release. If you're keen to get started shipping amazing apps, I suggest you start by watching the Play by Play. If you're already comfortable with the fundamentals of Xamarin, there are plenty of other great courses on Pluralsight that covers more in-depth topics.
