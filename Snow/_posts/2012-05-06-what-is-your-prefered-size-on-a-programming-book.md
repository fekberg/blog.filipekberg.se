As you might already know I am currently authoring a book called "A C# Smorgasbord". The work on the book is going great and will, if everything goes as planned, be released later this summer (mid/late July).<!--excerpt-->

However, before the book goes off to print, I want to know what trim size you guys prefer, meaning the size of a page(the book when it's closed). The poll below lists the standard trim sizes available. 

So please cast your vote to make this book perfect! <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/csp-mw-static/Trim-Size%20Comparison.pdf">Here's a PDF</a> that compares a lot of different trim sizes.

<strong>Voting has ended</strong>! Based on the votes C# Smorgasbord got its trim size it has today! Thanks everyone that voted.
