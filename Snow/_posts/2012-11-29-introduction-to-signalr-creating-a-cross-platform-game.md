If not, you're really missing out! While preparing for a Swedish .NET User Group presentation, I did a test screencast on all my content that was going into the presentation. This screencast is uploaded to youtube so go check it out! It's a bit over 1 hour long but well worth it if you want to get started with SignalR or just get some new inspiration!<!--excerpt-->
