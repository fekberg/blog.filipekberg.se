###Having a look at Visual Studio 2015
<img src="http://cdn.filipekberg.se/fekberg-blog/visual-studio-2015-preview-and-open-sourcing-dotnet-announced/VisualStudio2015.png" alt="" style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; width: 200px;">The next version of Visual Studio is right around the corner, it has previously been referred to as Visual Studio 14 but has now gotten its name; Visual Studio 2015. This new version of Visual Studio does not only include a bunch of new features that will make developers happier and more productive, but it also includes a new version in the family that means that you as a community contributor can get completely free version of Visual Studio 2015!<!--excerpt--><br/><br/>As any new version of Visual Studio, it's packed with amazing features that makes our lives as developers much easier. If you have been following the news you know that Microsoft have completely re-written their C# and VB compilers which are now completely written in managed code, open source and is called the .NET Compiler Platform. I am extremely excited about this being the compilers that will ship with Visual Studio 2015. It means that it is much easier for Microsoft and other vendors to extend the experience when working with C# and VB applications.

The power of the new .NET Compiler Platform has been shining through with Code Lense in the previous updates for Visual Studio 2013, which means that we have been getting a better experience when refactoring code out of the box with Visual Studio. With Visual Studio 2015 Preview, you will see analysers and refactoring packages being installed over NuGet, which will make it easier for anyone to distribute rules and fixes for common (and not so common) code issues. This will integrate nicely in the already very nice and pleasant refactoring experience in Visual Studio 2015 Preview.

####Lambda Expressions in Watch and Immediate Window
This new feature will give us a completely different debugging experience! Over the yearâ€™s one of the most annoying things have been to debug lambda expressions, but no more! Visual Studio 2015 Preview ships with a nice revamped watch and immediate window that will allow you to write lambdas and LINQ!
